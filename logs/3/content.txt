So much has happened in the past year. Just yesterday, Wilson managed to break two plates and a cup by knocking them off a counter when he was running around. He is extremely active and curious, but he frequently goes overboard and he gets a timeout. At first, I was a little concerned when he started walking a little late, but after all of this running there is nothing worry about. He first started walking without help about a month after his first birthday and started running about four months ago. He has some stranger axiety around adults but he seems to get along with other children his age pretty well. After a little more than halfway through the year, he started forming phrases and small sentences with the words he learned. Recently, we started working on counting and he has managed to consistantly counting to three without mixing up the order. One time, he even counted up to 7 correctly, but he frequently confuses the order so we’ll have to keep working on it. Overall, he has made a whole lot of progress and aside from the hyperactivity, I don’t think there is too much to be concerned about now.

A while ago, I found a long term babysitter for Wilson and I’m considering sending him to preschool next year. I think he would really enjoy interacting with more children his age. It seems like he really enjoys playing with big legos and building random things with them, so I just keep him occupied with those instead of letting him use technology. Sometimes, when were out of the house and he doesn’t have his toys, I let him watch a couple videos when he has nothing else to do. I would like to somehow avoid any technology addiction later in his life so I try to find as many other things as possible. Hyperactivity would definately be the greatest challege of anything.
