Hi, My name is Patrick Wang and I just adopted a newborn baby boy today. Since his birth parents let me choose a name for him, I spent a couple days coming up with one. I eventually settled with Wilson after the volleyball from Castaway. Originally I was going to go with Clarence, Coco, or just coconut after the shape of his head. 
\n
At the moment, I am taking care of Wilson by myself, however, I might consider having someone else take care of him with me since I’m worried I might not have enough time to take care of him being a single parent. I also think it would be good for Wilson to have someone else in his life for him to look up to. After some research online, I found that “Children in two-parent families do better in life”. Being a single parent may provide more freedom and eliminate disagreement, it would also give me a lot of extra responsibility. 
\n
While researching, I also looked into and adopted child’s personality. It turns out that they resemble their biological parents personalities more, even if they have never met. This should be fine since Wilson’s parents seemed like very nice, they just weren’t financially stable enough to support him. 
\n
Even though, through the brief interactions with his parents, his parents seemed like sensible people, I am still concerned with his health since I was not there during the pregnancy and I do not have any information about their genetic history. Since Wilson was adopted, I don’t really know what he has gone through throughout his prenatal development. I also feel like it would a very big challenge figuring out how to reschedule my life around Wilson and making sure he becomes moral person. I hope he will at least lead a life that he is satisfied with. I am both anxious and excited about meeting Wilson and how his future will turn out.

Although I wasn’t there during the pregnancy, I have looked into prenatal development. If I was there, I would have witnessed the mother experience fatigue, morning sickness, headaches, etc. I have also heard that contractions can be extremely painful.
