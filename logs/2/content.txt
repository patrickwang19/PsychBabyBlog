Oh boy, what a busy year it has been. Just last month, Wilson said my name! About half way through the year, he said “bye-bye”, his first word, when we left the grocery store. He started crawling around the same time. He first rolled over after 5 months and stood up by himself for the first time last week, but still hasn’t been able to walk. This is slightly concerning since, on average, children be taking their first steps by their first birthday, but it should be fine since that’s just an average. Otherwise, he seems to be pretty on track. While playing with the thing with different shaped blocks with corresponding holes, he has managed to put a few in the right way. It also seems like he has a pretty secure attachment since after he began to crawl, he has been exploring everything, and putting things in his mouth.

For most of the year, Wilson has been an extremely light sleeper, waking up and crying constantly. After months of comforting him and putting him back to sleep, I decided to let him “cry it out”. I felt bad so this ended up only lasting a couple of days. There is a lot of mix research online about this, but in 2016, CNN reported on some research that concluded that letting babies cry it out was effective. Babies who cried it out slept almost 15 minutes faster than the control group. It also turns out that the experiment did not stress the babies out short term or long term. I am still worried for Wilson’s well being since this was only one studys next to others saying that it’s bad so I decided to just help him sleep. Recently he has actually been sleeping far better so it’s been much less of an issue.
