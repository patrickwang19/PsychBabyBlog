Yesterday was Wilson’s third birthday, the first birthday that he celebrated with friends. He invited some of his friends over and we went to Lord’s and got ice cream. Afterward, we went back home and they just played with legos and other toys for a while. This year, he has really improved his coordination since he hasn’t been falling on his face as often. That also means he’s much harder to catch when he’s running around. He has begun to speak in more complete sentences and has already managed to call a random stranger fat to their face. He is also asking many more questions, saying “why” after everything, is able to sing the alphabet without mixing up many letters, and can add combinations of 1, 2, and 3.

This year, Wilson has been going to preschool, and it seems like he enjoys it. I have only gotten a couple of complaints from teachers, but it’s nothing i didn’t expect. It seems like at times, he has some trouble paying attention during class and is still a little hyperactive, but is otherwise well behaved. I also heard from teachers that he gets along with other children well and is academically strong. Of course, there have been times when Wilson has misbehaved and I have had to step in. Usually, when he does something little, like being too loud or refusing to do something, I just scold him, but earlier in the year, when he broke a vase at a restaurant when he was running around, I took away his means of entertainment for a couple days. He was not very happy about it, but afterwards, he looked like he felt bad about it and I’m sure he learned his lesson.
